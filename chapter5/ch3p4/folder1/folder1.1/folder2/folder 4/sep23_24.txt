Had a placement drive at Holiday Inn Kochi.
Attended aptitude test, programming test written and Group discussion.
The chosen people can attend interview at their kochi office, which will be announced in a week. I am waiting if i am eligible for that. The day went like that and couldnt do the project as i was tired after whole process.

Today i completed javascript tutorials till chapter 4. Worked out exercises at end of each chapter. Have to start coding next day.
